<p>"Above The Fray" is a new single released by JJ Lin on December 24, 2024, and is also the theme song for his "JJ20 FINALLAP" final tour. The arrangement incorporates string and electronic music, and the lyrics focus on the belief of "jumping out of trouble and transcending time". It not only looks back on the footprints of 20 years since his debut, but also sets a high-spirited start for the next musical journey.</p>
